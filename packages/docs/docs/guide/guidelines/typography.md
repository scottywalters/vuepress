## Type Tokens
Sun Nuclear uses type tokens to manage typography. Type tokens are pre-configured sets of typographic attributes such as font size, weight, and line-height that are calibrated for use with the Helvetica Neue typeface. 
Layouts usually have several areas that require varying typographic hierarchies. Type Tokens also help to bridge the communication gap between design and development. The tokens allow the design assets to translate into coded solutions.


## Typeface: Helvetica Neue

### Backstory
The HelveticaÂ® (Latin for Swiss) has the objective and functional style which was associated with Swiss typography in the 1950s and 1960s. The font is perfect for international correspondence: no ornament, no emotion, just clear presentation of information.
